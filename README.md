# Dear QA

A love letter from your humble UI Front End Developer

As QA's one of the crucial part is to collaborate with the devs, to have a great understanding of each others roles & expectations. In the modern agile frameworks, its equally important to know, what dev teams need as much as it is important for devs to think what QA's need.

I want to share what I've learnt from QA's/Testers and how it has helped me grow over the years. I also would like to encourage the good work of those who are already doing these things.

This talk was prepared for:
- [Wellington Testers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Testers/events/260660347/) - 9th May 2019
